## 📌 About the Repository
This repository contains a structured collection of C programming implementations developed during my **BSc Computer Science** degree. The focus is on mastering procedural logic, low-level memory management, and efficient algorithm design.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **/src**: The primary source code files (.c) for various logic problems.
- **/assignments**: College-specific laboratory tasks and practicals.
- **/docs**: Logical explanations, flowcharts, and algorithm pseudocode.

## 🛠️ Concepts Covered
- **Fundamentals:** Data types, operators, and control flow (if-else, loops).
- **Functions:** Modular programming and recursion.
- **Memory Management:** Pointers, DMA (`malloc`, `free`), and address arithmetic.
- **Data Structures:** Implementation of Arrays, Strings, and Structures.
- **File I/O:** Reading/writing data to external files.
